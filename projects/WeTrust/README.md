# WeTrust

## Abstract

Discoverability on chain for new applications and assets depends on centralized verification systems. While this is doesn't imply security issue it creates a significant hurdle in scaling to meet all the future newly created applications and assets.

Some other attempts to completely decentralize these systems tends to hit a hard wall when faced on how to reach consensus while scaling. Is it DAO based? Token based or Account based?

Through a social network of trust, each user can creates his own scoring system based on trusted peers.
